- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?---
At lower goals, the successful and failed outcomes are at a similar level. With higher goals, the percentage successful is higher than the percentage failed. The number of projects are higher with lower goals compare to projects with higher goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?---
The dataset only contain data from 2009 to 2017, which means the dataset is out of date.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?---
We can also creates chart like average donation versus subcategory. From this chart we would be able to see which category people would like to fund.
